In this project we had to create both servers and clients using Java and C.
My programs currently are able to connect with each other and communicate simple
requests such as the ID of the agent running, and returning user input through tcp.

Through much effort I was only able to achieve simple sending and receiving.
I hit many roadblocks as I have no experience with sockets and threads.

With sockets I learned how to open and connect both UDP and TCP sockets.
The method for using each was very similar, but there were a few changes
such as using binding.

One major roadblock I hit was the local address in java and C. In C this was
simple to implement. However on java it took much trial and error in order
to finally communicate with the C program.

I also learned with big endian and little endian how these bits are transferred.
After being very confused with having mismatched data I realized that my bits
were not the same as I had thought and I was able to fix this issue in java by
converting to little endian.

The next issue I faced was learning about threads in both languages.
The concept of threads was not hard to follow. However, implementing them
posed a challenge. Learning about interrupts and locks helped me figure this out.

Overall this was a fun project, despite the many challenges that I faced because
I was able to learn new skills that were completely foreign to me when I had
started.
